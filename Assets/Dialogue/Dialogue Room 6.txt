Professor/Yikes! In this room there's an enemy!/Be careful, they patrol a set area, but once they see you, they'll give chase/Once they're close enough, they'll stop to charge up and then dash at you at full speed/They're capable of killing NK cells, destroying barrels and hurting you/But, you can stun them by swinging your saber at them, and dodge them by rolling/You can't permanently get rid of them though, so your best option is to sneak around or try to outrun them/Good Luck!
